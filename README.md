# netVLAD
This is an implementation of netVLAD in TensorFlow 1.0. 
The implementation follows the paper: 
[Arandjelovic, Relja, et al. "NetVLAD: CNN architecture for weakly supervised place recognition." 
Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2016.] (http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Arandjelovic_NetVLAD_CNN_Architecture_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)


This acts as an orderless pooling layer.
